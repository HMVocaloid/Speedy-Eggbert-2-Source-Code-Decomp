# Speedy Eggbert 2 Source Code Decomp
 WIP Source Tree for Speedy Eggbert (Blupi) 2

With the help of jummy in the Blupi Games Fan Server and his extensive work on Ghidra, we've began to get a bigger understanding on how Speedy Eggbert 2 works.

Why are we doing this?
 As of now (5/17/24), there hasn't been any source code found for SE2. So we are using the released (original) source code from Planet Blupi to compare code and help us with the proccess.
